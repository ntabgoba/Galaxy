#Cleaning Data Samsung Galaxy II 

##Overview 
This project is meant to demonstrate collection and cleaning of a raw data set into a tidy data set. The produced tidy data set can hence be used for further analysis. Detailed information about the raw data set can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository website:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

###Script 
The script downloads the raw data set, unzipps it and does a series of descriptive analysis to lay out the its main contents. It concatenates the data table and labels the variables appropriately.

###Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information:You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
